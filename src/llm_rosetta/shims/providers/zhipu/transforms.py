"""Zhipu (GLM) schema transforms.

Zhipu does not support ``n``, ``presence_penalty``, ``frequency_penalty``,
``logprobs``, ``top_logprobs``, ``logit_bias``, or ``seed``.
Strip them before sending upstream to avoid errors.

Additionally, ``temperature`` range is [0, 1] (vs OpenAI's [0, 2]) and
``top_p`` minimum is 0.01.  These value-range adjustments are not handled
by simple field stripping and may need future transform support.
